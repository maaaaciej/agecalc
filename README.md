<h1>Age calculator</h1>

A quick application put together for /u/ToqKaizogu on Reddit.

The application lets users add people and their date of birth into a list. The user can then enter any date in the input field, and see the calculated age of each of the characters on any given date.

<i>9/8/20</i>

Initial commit, added a header and the inputs, as well as defining the architechture of the application.
